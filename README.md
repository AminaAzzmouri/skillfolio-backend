# Skillfolio Backend

This is the backend of **Skillfolio**, a web application that helps self-learners archive their certificates, track skills, and connect achievements to projects.

Built with **Django REST Framework**, the backend provides secure APIs for authentication, certificate management, and project linking.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

# Project Setup Instructions:

# 1. Clone repo

     git clone https://github.com/AminaAzzmouri/skillfolio-backend.git

# 2. Create a virtual environment

     python -m venv venv

# 3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    - macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install dependencies

- We keep all backend dependencies pinned in requirements.txt (includes Django, DRF, JWT auth, CORS, filtering, Swagger docs, SimpleJWT (blacklist support is built-in & (optionally) S3 storage support).
  pip install -r requirements.txt

- If you add/change packages, re-freeze:
  pip freeze > requirements.txt

# 5. Apply migrations:

     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate

# 5.1. (Optional) Seed demo data for quick testing

     python manage.py seed_demo

# 6. Run the server:

     python manage.py runserver

# 7. (Already included) users app

- This repo already includes a `users` app which centralizes user, certificate, project, and goal logic.
  No need to re-create it.

#### **App Explanation:**

     The users app is the central place for user-related domain models and logic (users, certificates, projects, goals) to avoid fragmentation and simplify relationships.

     This approach simplifies relationships between models, reduces overhead in project structure, and keeps the code easier to maintain, especially in a project where all features are tightly related to users‚Äô achievements and certificates.

#### Add 'users' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:

     INSTALLED_APPS = [
     ...,
     'rest_framework',
     'users', # <-- newly created app
     ]

# 8. Install backend auth & integration deps: (JWT, CORS, filtering)

(Already covered by requirements.txt; shown here for clarity)

       pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt django-cors-headers django-filter

# 9. Security & polish:

- Restrict CORS to your frontend origin.
- Add validation (e.g., no past deadline, file size/type check).
- Add search/ordering params to README.
- Add Swagger/OpenAPI (e.g., drf-yasg) and basic tests.
- Swagger docs configured with Bearer token support: use the "Authorize" button in /api/docs

       ‚Üí paste: `Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>` (after logging in via /api/auth/login/)

# üîë Logout & Token Blacklist Notes

- Logout works by blacklisting refresh tokens, so they can‚Äôt be reused.  
- This is enabled via `rest_framework_simplejwt.token_blacklist` in `INSTALLED_APPS`.  
- **No extra pip install is required** ‚Äî `djangorestframework-simplejwt` already includes the blacklist app.  
- Just make sure migrations have been run to create the blacklist tables:

       python manage.py migrate

---

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Done So Far

# Authentication

- JWT login with email/username
- Register endpoint (dev helper)
- Refresh endpoint
- Logout endpoint (refresh tokens are blacklisted via `rest_framework_simplejwt.token_blacklist` ‚Üí already included by default, no extra install needed) ‚úÖ

# Certificates

- Model, serializer, viewset, endpoints
- File upload support with size/type validation (‚â§ 5MB, PDF/Images)
- Date validation: no future date_earned

# Projects

- Model, serializer, viewset, endpoints
- Linked to certificates (nullable)
- Guided fields (work_type, duration_text, primary_goal, etc.)
- Auto-generated description if blank
- status field: planned, in_progress, completed

# Goals

- Model, serializer, viewset, endpoints
- Fields: title, target_projects, deadline, total_steps, completed_steps
- Validations: deadline in the future, target_projects > 0; checklist fields clamped
- Computed fields:
  * progress_percent ‚Äî from completed projects vs target_projects
  * steps_progress_percent ‚Äî from checklist (completed_steps / total_steps)
- NEW GoalSteps (named checklist items): /api/goalsteps/ (CRUD), owner-scoped

# Filters / Search / Ordering

- Certificates: filter by issuer/date, search title/issuer, order by date/title
- Projects: filter by certificate/status, search title/description, order by date/title
- Goals: filter by deadline, order by created_at

# Analytics

- /api/analytics/summary/ ‚Üí counts of certificates, projects, goals
- /api/analytics/goals-progress/ ‚Üí list of goals with progress

# Docs

- Swagger docs now working (/api/docs/).

# Admin

- Certificates: issuer/date filters, searchable title/issuer, ordered by newest
- Projects: status/work_type filters, searchable fields, newest-first ordering
- Goals: title, target/deadline + checklist fields (total_steps, completed_steps), computed steps progress column; inline GoalStep rows; ordered by deadline
  ‚Üí Admin is now great for quick QA/debugging of goal checklists

# Basic API smoke tests (auth, certs, projects, analytics) ‚úÖ

# Demo data seeding (optional): 
- provides quick demo content for testing.
- Management command (`python manage.py seed_demo`) ‚Üí idempotent, works even on an existing DB.
- Could create a demo user + sample certificate/project/goal for fast onboarding.

# Deployment foundations

- Env-driven settings (DEBUG/SECRET_KEY/ALLOWED_HOSTS/CORS).
- Static files via WhiteNoise; Gunicorn start command ready.
- Optional S3 media wiring behind USE_S3_MEDIA.
- CI runs tests on GitHub Actions (Python 3.11).

---

## üîÆ What‚Äôs Next

# Goals: Introduce a computed or persisted **status field** (e.g., on_track, achieved, expired).

- Computed option: calculate status dynamically from `progress_percent` and `deadline` in the serializer (no schema change).
- Persisted option: add a `status` field in the model (with choices) and update automatically when goals are met or deadlines pass.

* This would make goals more informative by clearly showing whether they are still in progress, completed, or expired.

# Admin polish (future):

- Group fields in detail forms (Basic Info, Guided Fields, Links)
- Add inline previews for related certificates/projects

# Permissions (optional):

- Add an object-level permission class for extra safety on top of owner scoping

# Deployment hardening:

- Restrict CORS to FE origin (set CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=False and provide your real domain in CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in production env).
- Production DB migration to managed Postgres/MySQL (add a DATABASE_URL/prod settings and migrate).
- Caching & performance (e.g., Redis cache backend, DRF throttling, gzip, logging/observability).

# Test coverage:

- Expand beyond smoke tests (edge cases, permissions, validations).

# Swagger annotations 
(@swagger_auto_schema) for nicer grouping/descriptions.

# Rate limiting / throttling for auth endpoints (DRF throttling classes).

# Logging basics (REST errors, request IDs).

# File storage for prod (S3 or similar) if you want stretch goals.

**GoalSteps**: Base: /api/goalsteps/

- Named checklist items attached to a goal.
- Typical workflow: create steps ‚Üí toggle `is_done` as you progress ‚Üí reorder with `order` if desired.
- All endpoints are owner-scoped via the parent goal.

## üìñ API Documentation (Swagger / drf-yasg)

1.  What we already have:

    - /api/docs/ ‚Üí interactive API docs.
      Lists all endpoints (certificates, projects, goals, auth, analytics, logout).

    - You can try requests directly from the browser by pasting Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN> into the ‚ÄúAuthorize‚Äù button.

    - /api/schema/ ‚Üí machine-readable OpenAPI JSON spec (useful for frontend integration and API clients).

‚ÑπÔ∏è Auth endpoints (register/login/logout) are now grouped under "Auth" in Swagger.
    - Register: create a user
    - Login: get access/refresh
    - Authorize: paste `Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>` to unlock protected endpoints
    - Logout: blacklist refresh token

2.  What more we could add with @swagger_auto_schema:

With @swagger_auto_schema decorators, we can also:

- Add descriptions ‚Üí clear human-friendly explanations for each operation.
- Customize schemas ‚Üí define exact input/output when auto-detection is imperfect.

3. Why this matters

   - Frontend devs & testers ‚Üí instantly know what each endpoint expects.
   - Contributors ‚Üí clearer reference if the API is ever made public.
   - Future me ‚Üí easy reminder of inputs/outputs after a break.

---

## üîë Swagger Auth Workflow (Step-by-Step):

When testing APIs in /api/docs/, follow this sequence:

1. Register a user (optional if you already created one):
    - Endpoint: POST /api/auth/register/
    - Body: {"email":"you@example.com","password":"pass1234"}
    - Returns the new user‚Äôs id/username/email.

2. Login to get tokens
    - Endpoint: POST /api/auth/login/
    - Body: {"email":"you@example.com","password":"pass1234"}
    - Response: { "refresh":"...", "access":"..." }

3. Authorize in Swagger UI
    - Click the green Authorize button (top-right in /api/docs).
    - Paste: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>
    - ‚úÖ Now all protected endpoints (certificates, projects, goals, analytics) will work directly from the Swagger interface.

4. Logout when done
    - Endpoint: POST /api/auth/logout/
    - Body: {"refresh":"<your_refresh_token>"}
    - This blacklists the refresh token ‚Üí prevents reuse.

## üîç Quick cURL Examples:

python manage.py collectstatic --noinput # (harmless; if STATIC configured)
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

# 1) Register:

            curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/register/ \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"email":"you@example.com","password":"pass1234"}'

* Returns the new user‚Äôs id/username/email (email is used as the username).



# 2) Login ‚Üí get access/refresh

- With email

            curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login/ \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"email":"you@example.com","password":"pass1234"}'

- With username

            curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login/ \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"username":"you@example.com","password":"pass1234"}'

- You‚Äôll receive { "access": "...", "refresh": "..." }.

* access ‚Üí short-lived token for Authorization headers.
* refresh ‚Üí longer-lived token you can use at /api/auth/refresh/.

- Use Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN> for protected endpoints.

- With the access token, you can call GET /api/certificates/, POST /api/certificates/ (for creation), and similar endpoints for projects and goals.
  Because the viewsets use OwnerScopedModelViewSet, each user sees only their own certificates/projects/goals.

- Renew when expired

            curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/refresh/ \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## ‚ö° Development Notes

- All resources are scoped per user (you only ever see your own objects).
- Pagination enabled ‚Üí use ?page=N.
- Default ordering:
  - Certificates: newest first (-date_earned)
  - Projects: newest first (-date_created)
  - Goals: newest first (-created_at). Ordering supports deadline and checklist fields.
- For production: set DEBUG=False, restrict ALLOWED_HOSTS, and configure CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS to your FE domain.

---

## üß™ Running Tests

- We use Django‚Äôs built-in test runner with pytest-style assertions for quick backend verification.

### Run all tests:

            python manage.py test

- By default, Django shows . for each passing test.

### Run with verbose output

            python manage.py test -v 2

- This will display the name + status of each test

             test_create_certificate ... ok, test_login_refresh ... ok

- Recommended when recording a demo or debugging.

### Run a single test (by dotted path)

            python manage.py test users.tests.test_api.TestAPI::test_login_refresh -v 2

- This prints the test name and status, great for demos.

- What‚Äôs covered:

  - Auth
    ** Login returns access + refresh.
    ** Refresh exchanges a refresh for a new access token.
    ** Logout blacklists the refresh (subsequent refresh fails).

  - Certificates
    ** Create via JSON.
    ** Create via multipart (in-memory PDF upload).
    ** PATCH updates (e.g., title change).
    ** DELETE removes item and a follow-up GET returns 404.
    ** Owner scoping proven by creating data for a second user and ensuring your list only shows your items.

  - Projects
    ** Create without a certificate.
    ** Create with a certificate.
    ** PATCH updates (status change; link/unlink a certificate).
    ** DELETE removes item and a follow-up GET returns 404.
    ** Owner scoping on list.

  - Goals
    ** Full CRUD path: create ‚Üí list ‚Üí patch ‚Üí get ‚Üí delete ‚Üí not found.
    ** Validations: negative target_projects and past deadline.
    ** Computed field: progress_percent updates as projects are completed and as target changes.

  - Analytics
    ** /api/analytics/summary/ returns the three user-scoped counts and you assert sensible minima.
    
  - Docs    
    ** /api/docs/ and /api/schema/ both return 200.

### Notes

- Tests live in users/tests/.
- users/tests/**init**.py makes sure the folder is treated as a package and discovered automatically.
- Tests create an isolated test database and do not touch your dev data.

### Continuous Integration

- GitHub Actions runs the test suite on every push and pull request.
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

---

## üöÄ Deployment (env-based settings)

- In production, configure settings via environment variables instead of editing code (e.g., `.env` or your host provider‚Äôs panel).

- Create an `.env` (or set real env vars in your host) with:

            DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-strong-random-string
            DJANGO_DEBUG=False
            DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com

- Choose one of the following CORS configs:

 * For local dev only (permissive)

            CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=True

 * For production (restrict to your FE origin)
            CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=False
            CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.example.com

**Notes**

- When `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`, the app **requires** `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` (safe default is enforced in code).
- `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is comma-separated, no spaces.
- Prefer `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in production; keep `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=True` only for local dev.

 ### üì¶ S3 Media (optional, production)

- To serve uploads from S3, set:

            USE_S3_MEDIA=True
            AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket
            AWS_S3_REGION_NAME=us-east-1

# If not using instance role:

            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

# Optional CDN/CloudFront:
            AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=cdn.skillfolio.example.com

  * Make the bucket public or keep private with signed URLs (AWS_QUERYSTRING_AUTH=True).
  * If using CloudFront, set AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN to your distribution domain.

---

## üì¶ Demo Data (optional)

- You can preload demo data for quick testing:

  *Option A ‚Äî Fixtures (best with a fresh DB)**

            python manage.py loaddata fixtures/seed.json

  *Option B ‚Äî Management Command (idempotent)**

            python manage.py seed_demo

- Creates:
  * demo user: `demo@skillfolio.dev` / password hash preset `pass1234`
  * 1 certificate, 1 project (linked to that certificate), and 1 goal
