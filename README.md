# Skillfolio Backend

This is the backend of **Skillfolio**, a web application that helps self-learners archive their certificates, track skills, and connect achievements to projects.

Built with **Django REST Framework**, the backend provides secure APIs for authentication, certificate management, and project linking.

---

## üöÄ Features (Planned)

- User authentication (register, login, logout, JWT)
- Upload and manage certificates (PDF, with metadata: title, date, specialty)
- CRUD for achievements
- Link projects to certificates (with guided description form + auto-generated description from guided answers ‚úÖ)
- Set and track learning goals (with deadlines, validations, and progress tracking ‚úÖ)
- Filtering / search / ordering across list endpoints ‚úÖ (see Quick Reference)
- Analytics endpoints for dashboard summary & goal progress (frontend) ‚úÖ
- Interactive API docs with Swagger/OpenAPI (drf-yasg) ‚úÖ
- Polished Django Admin (list_display, filters, search, ordering) ‚úÖ

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python / Django
- Django REST Framework (DRF)
- SQLite (development) / MySQL (production)
- JWT Authentication
- django-filter (filtering)
- django-cors-headers (CORS)

## ‚ö° Getting Started

# Project Setup Instructions:
===========================================================================

# 1. Clone repo
     git clone https://github.com/AminaAzzmouri/skillfolio-backend.git

# 2. Create a virtual environment
     python -m venv venv

# 3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    - macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install Django:
     pip install django

# 5. Install dependencies
- We keep all backend dependencies pinned in requirements.txt (includes DRF, CORS, filters, SimpleJWT and the token blacklist extra for logout).
     pip install -r requirements.txt

- If you add/change packages, re-freeze:
     pip freeze > requirements.txt

# 5. Start the Django project:
     django-admin startproject skillfolio_backend

# 6. Apply migrations:
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate

The blacklist tables for logout are created here because 
     rest_framework_simplejwt.token_blacklist is installed

# 7. Run the server:
     python manage.py runserver

# 8. Create the users app  (if it doesn‚Äôt exist yet):

#### Inside the Django project folder (where manage.py is located), run:
     python manage.py startapp users

#### **App Explanation:**  
     The users app is the central place for user-related domain models and logic (users, certificates, projects, goals) to avoid fragmentation and simplify relationships.
      
     This approach simplifies relationships between models, reduces overhead in project structure, and keeps the code easier to maintain, especially in a project where all features are tightly related to users‚Äô achievements and certificates.

#### Add 'users' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:

     INSTALLED_APPS = [
     ...,
     'rest_framework',
     'users', # <-- newly created app
     ]

# 9. Install backend auth & integration deps: (JWT, CORS, filtering)
(Already covered by requirements.txt; shown here for clarity)     

       pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt django-cors-headers django-filter
     
## For logout blacklist support:
       pip install "djangorestframework-simplejwt[token_blacklist]"
       pip freeze > requirements.txt

# 10. Security & polish:
  - Restrict CORS to your frontend origin.
  - Add validation (e.g., no past deadline, file size/type check).
  - Add search/ordering params to README.
  - Add Swagger/OpenAPI (e.g., drf-yasg) and basic tests.

---

## üß™ Running Tests

- Run the built-in API smoke tests:

            python manage.py test

- What‚Äôs covered:
* Auth: login (access/refresh) and refresh flow
* Certificates: create (json + multipart) and list (owner scoped)
* Projects: create (with/without certificate) and list (owner scoped)
* Analytics: /api/analytics/summary/ returns counts for the logged-in user

---

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Done So Far

# Authentication
* JWT login with email/username
* Register endpoint (dev helper)
* Refresh endpoint
* Logout endpoint (blacklist refresh tokens) ‚Üí /api/auth/logout/ ‚úÖ

# Certificates
* Model, serializer, viewset, endpoints
* File upload support with size/type validation (‚â§ 5MB, PDF/Images)
* Date validation: no future date_earned

# Projects
* Model, serializer, viewset, endpoints
* Linked to certificates (nullable)
* Guided fields (work_type, duration_text, primary_goal, etc.)
* Auto-generated description if blank
* status field: planned, in_progress, completed

# Goals
* Model, serializer, viewset, endpoints
* Validations: deadline in the future, target_projects > 0
* Computed progress_percent included in responses

# Filters / Search / Ordering
* Certificates: filter by issuer/date, search title/issuer, order by date/title
* Projects: filter by certificate/status, search title/description, order by date/title
* Goals: filter by deadline, order by created_at

# Analytics
* /api/analytics/summary/ ‚Üí counts of certificates, projects, goals
* /api/analytics/goals-progress/ ‚Üí list of goals with progress

# Docs
* Swagger docs now working (/api/docs/).

# Admin
* Certificates: issuer/date filters, searchable title/issuer, ordered by newest
* Projects: status/work_type filters, searchable fields, newest-first ordering
* Goals: deadline filters, searchable targets, ordered by deadline
‚Üí Admin now useful for quick QA/debugging

---

## üîÆ What‚Äôs Next

# Permissions (nice to have): 
Optional object-level permission class (extra belt-and-suspenders; current owner scoping via queryset is already enforced).

# Frontend polish support:
- Project edit/delete flows
- Certificate preview (image/PDF in dashboard cards)
- Dashboard graphs for counts/progress

# Deployment hardening:
 - Restrict CORS to FE origin
 - Production DB migration to MySQL/PostgreSQL
 - Add caching & performance tuning
 - Unit & integration tests

# Admin polish (future):
- Group fields in detail forms (Basic Info, Guided Fields, Links)
- Add inline previews for related certificates/projects

# Goals: Introduce a computed or persisted **status field** (e.g., on_track, achieved, expired).  
   * Computed option: calculate status dynamically from `progress_percent` and `deadline` in the serializer (no schema change).  
   * Persisted option: add a `status` field in the model (with choices) and update automatically when goals are met or deadlines pass.  
   This would make goals more informative by clearly showing whether they are still in progress, completed, or expired.

## üìñ API Documentation (Swagger / drf-yasg)

1. What we already have:
     * /api/docs/ ‚Üí interactive API docs. 
       Lists all endpoints (certificates, projects, goals, auth, analytics, logout).

     * You can try requests directly from the browser by pasting Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN> into the ‚ÄúAuthorize‚Äù button.

     * /api/schema/ ‚Üí machine-readable OpenAPI JSON spec (useful for frontend integration and API clients).

2. What extra annotations could add:
Currently, Swagger auto-generates docs from ViewSets and serializers. If we add @swagger_auto_schema decorators, we can:

     * Group endpoints with tags ‚Üí e.g., put login/logout/register under Auth.

     * Add descriptions ‚Üí clear human-friendly explanations for each operation.

     * Customize schemas ‚Üí define exact input/output when auto-detection is imperfect.

Example:
     @swagger_auto_schema(
    tags=["Auth"],
    operation_description="Login with email + password. Returns access and refresh JWT tokens."
     )
     def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
     ...

3. Why this matters

     * Frontend devs & testers ‚Üí instantly know what each endpoint expects.
     * Contributors ‚Üí clearer reference if the API is ever made public.
     * Future me ‚Üí easy reminder of inputs/outputs after a break.

‚úÖ In short:
 /api/docs/ already works well.
 Adding annotations is optional, but makes the docs prettier, grouped, and self-explanatory.

## üîç Quick cURL Examples: 

python manage.py collectstatic --noinput  # (harmless; if STATIC configured)
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

# 1) Register:

            curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/register/ \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"email":"you@example.com","password":"pass1234"}'
  
          Returns the new user‚Äôs id/username/email (email is used as the username).
  
       
# 2) Login ‚Üí get access/refresh

            curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login/ \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"username":"you@example.com","password":"pass1234"}'

- You‚Äôll receive { "access": "...", "refresh": "..." }. 
* access ‚Üí short-lived token for Authorization headers.
* refresh ‚Üí longer-lived token you can use at /api/auth/refresh/.
  
- Use Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN> for protected endpoints.

- With the access token, you can call GET /api/certificates/, POST /api/certificates/ (for creation), and similar endpoints for projects and goals. 
  Because the viewsets use OwnerScopedModelViewSet, each user sees only their own certificates/projects/goals.

- Renew when expired

            curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/refresh/ \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"refresh":"YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"}'

            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"title":"Django Basics","issuer":"Coursera","date_earned":"2024-08-01"}'
