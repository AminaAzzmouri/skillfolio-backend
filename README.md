# Skillfolio Backend

This is the backend of **Skillfolio**, a web application that helps self-learners archive their certificates, track skills, and connect achievements to projects.

Built with **Django REST Framework**, the backend provides secure APIs for authentication, certificate management, and project linking.

---

## üöÄ Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented

- User authentication (register, login, logout, JWT)
- Upload and manage certificates (PDF, with metadata: title, date)
- CRUD for achievements (Certificates, Projects, Goals)
- Link projects to certificates (guided fields + auto-generated description)
- Set and track learning goals (with deadlines, validations, and progress tracking)
- Filtering / search / ordering across list endpoints (see Quick Reference)
- Analytics endpoints for dashboard summary & goal progress (frontend)
- Interactive API docs with Swagger/OpenAPI (drf-yasg)
- Polished Django Admin (list_display, filters, search, ordering)
- Basic API smoke tests (auth, certs, projects, analytics)

### üõ† Planned / Nice-to-have

- Object-level permissions (extra belt-and-suspenders)
- Goal status UX (on_track / achieved / expired)
- CI + more test coverage
- Production storage (e.g., S3) for uploads

---

## ‚ö° Getting Started

# Project Setup Instructions:

===========================================================================

# 1. Clone repo

     git clone https://github.com/AminaAzzmouri/skillfolio-backend.git

# 2. Create a virtual environment

     python -m venv venv

# 3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    - macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install dependencies

- We keep all backend dependencies pinned in requirements.txt (includes DRF, CORS, filters, SimpleJWT and the token blacklist extra for logout).
  pip install -r requirements.txt

- If you add/change packages, re-freeze:
  pip freeze > requirements.txt

# 5. Apply migrations:

     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate

The blacklist tables for logout are created here because
rest_framework_simplejwt.token_blacklist is installed

# 6. Run the server:

     python manage.py runserver

# 7. (Already included) users app

- This repo already includes a `users` app which centralizes user, certificate, project, and goal logic.
  No need to re-create it.

#### **App Explanation:**

     The users app is the central place for user-related domain models and logic (users, certificates, projects, goals) to avoid fragmentation and simplify relationships.

     This approach simplifies relationships between models, reduces overhead in project structure, and keeps the code easier to maintain, especially in a project where all features are tightly related to users‚Äô achievements and certificates.

#### Add 'users' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:

     INSTALLED_APPS = [
     ...,
     'rest_framework',
     'users', # <-- newly created app
     ]

# 8. Install backend auth & integration deps: (JWT, CORS, filtering)

(Already covered by requirements.txt; shown here for clarity)

       pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt django-cors-headers django-filter


## For logout blacklist support:

       pip install "djangorestframework-simplejwt[token_blacklist]"
       pip freeze > requirements.txt

# 9. Security & polish:

- Restrict CORS to your frontend origin.
- Add validation (e.g., no past deadline, file size/type check).
- Add search/ordering params to README.
- Add Swagger/OpenAPI (e.g., drf-yasg) and basic tests.

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Done So Far

# Authentication

- JWT login with email/username
- Register endpoint (dev helper)
- Refresh endpoint
- Logout endpoint (blacklist refresh tokens) ‚Üí /api/auth/logout/ ‚úÖ

# Certificates

- Model, serializer, viewset, endpoints
- File upload support with size/type validation (‚â§ 5MB, PDF/Images)
- Date validation: no future date_earned

# Projects

- Model, serializer, viewset, endpoints
- Linked to certificates (nullable)
- Guided fields (work_type, duration_text, primary_goal, etc.)
- Auto-generated description if blank
- status field: planned, in_progress, completed

# Goals

- Model, serializer, viewset, endpoints
- Validations: deadline in the future, target_projects > 0
- Computed progress_percent included in responses

# Filters / Search / Ordering

- Certificates: filter by issuer/date, search title/issuer, order by date/title
- Projects: filter by certificate/status, search title/description, order by date/title
- Goals: filter by deadline, order by created_at

# Analytics

- /api/analytics/summary/ ‚Üí counts of certificates, projects, goals
- /api/analytics/goals-progress/ ‚Üí list of goals with progress

# Docs

- Swagger docs now working (/api/docs/).

# Admin

- Certificates: issuer/date filters, searchable title/issuer, ordered by newest
- Projects: status/work_type filters, searchable fields, newest-first ordering
- Goals: deadline filters, searchable targets, ordered by deadline
  ‚Üí Admin now useful for quick QA/debugging

# - Basic API smoke tests (auth, certs, projects, analytics) ‚úÖ

---

## üîÆ What‚Äôs Next

# Goals: Introduce a computed or persisted **status field** (e.g., on_track, achieved, expired).

- Computed option: calculate status dynamically from `progress_percent` and `deadline` in the serializer (no schema change).
- Persisted option: add a `status` field in the model (with choices) and update automatically when goals are met or deadlines pass.

* This would make goals more informative by clearly showing whether they are still in progress, completed, or expired.

# Admin polish (future):

- Group fields in detail forms (Basic Info, Guided Fields, Links)
- Add inline previews for related certificates/projects

# Permissions (optional):

- Add an object-level permission class for extra safety on top of owner scoping

# Deployment hardening:

- Restrict CORS to FE origin
- Production DB migration to MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Add caching & performance tuning

# Test coverage:

- Expand beyond smoke tests (edge cases, permissions, validations).

# Demo data seeding (optional): provide quick demo content for testing.

- Options:

  - JSON fixture (`fixtures/seed.json`) ‚Üí easy to load on a fresh DB.
  - Management command (`python manage.py seed_demo`) ‚Üí idempotent, works even on an existing DB.

- Could create a demo user + sample certificate/project/goal for fast onboarding.

## üìñ API Documentation (Swagger / drf-yasg)

1.  What we already have:

    - /api/docs/ ‚Üí interactive API docs.
      Lists all endpoints (certificates, projects, goals, auth, analytics, logout).

    - You can try requests directly from the browser by pasting Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN> into the ‚ÄúAuthorize‚Äù button.

    - /api/schema/ ‚Üí machine-readable OpenAPI JSON spec (useful for frontend integration and API clients).

2.  What extra annotations could add:
    Currently, Swagger auto-generates docs from ViewSets and serializers. If we add @swagger_auto_schema decorators, we can:

         * Group endpoints with tags ‚Üí e.g., put login/logout/register under Auth.

         * Add descriptions ‚Üí clear human-friendly explanations for each operation.

         * Customize schemas ‚Üí define exact input/output when auto-detection is imperfect.

Example:
@swagger_auto_schema(
tags=["Auth"],
operation_description="Login with email + password. Returns access and refresh JWT tokens."
)
def post(self, request, \*args, \*\*kwargs):
...

3. Why this matters

   - Frontend devs & testers ‚Üí instantly know what each endpoint expects.
   - Contributors ‚Üí clearer reference if the API is ever made public.
   - Future me ‚Üí easy reminder of inputs/outputs after a break.

‚úÖ In short:
/api/docs/ already works well.
Adding annotations is optional, but makes the docs prettier, grouped, and self-explanatory.

## üîç Quick cURL Examples:

python manage.py collectstatic --noinput # (harmless; if STATIC configured)
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

# 1) Register:

            curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/register/ \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"email":"you@example.com","password":"pass1234"}'

          Returns the new user‚Äôs id/username/email (email is used as the username).



# 2) Login ‚Üí get access/refresh

            curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login/ \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"username":"you@example.com","password":"pass1234"}'

- You‚Äôll receive { "access": "...", "refresh": "..." }.

* access ‚Üí short-lived token for Authorization headers.
* refresh ‚Üí longer-lived token you can use at /api/auth/refresh/.

- Use Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN> for protected endpoints.

- With the access token, you can call GET /api/certificates/, POST /api/certificates/ (for creation), and similar endpoints for projects and goals.
  Because the viewsets use OwnerScopedModelViewSet, each user sees only their own certificates/projects/goals.

- Renew when expired

            curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/refresh/ \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

            ‚ÄúPortfolio Dashboard was a team project completed in 2 weeks. The main goal was
            to deliver a functional feature. It addressed: Visualize certificate progress in
            one place. Key tools/skills: React, Django, DRF, React, Zustand, Tailwind. Outcome:

## ‚ö° Development Notes

- All resources are scoped per user (you only ever see your own objects).
- Pagination enabled ‚Üí use ?page=N.
- Default ordering:
  - Certificates: newest first (-date_earned)
  - Projects: newest first (-date_created)
  - Goals: newest first (-created_at)
- For production: set DEBUG=False, restrict ALLOWED_HOSTS, and configure CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS to your FE domain.

## üß™ Running Tests

- We use Django‚Äôs built-in test runner with pytest-style assertions for quick backend verification.

### Run all tests:

            python manage.py test

- By default, Django shows . for each passing test.

### Run with verbose output

            python manage.py test -v 2

- This will display the name + status of each test

             test_create_certificate ... ok, test_login_refresh ... ok

- Recommended when recording a demo or debugging.

### Run a single test (by dotted path)

            python manage.py test users.tests.test_api.TestAPI::test_login_refresh -v 2

- This prints the test name and status, great for demos.

- What‚Äôs covered:

  - Auth
    ** Login returns access + refresh.
    ** Refresh exchanges a refresh for a new access token.
    \*\* Logout blacklists the refresh (subsequent refresh fails).

  - Certificates
    ** Create via JSON.
    ** Create via multipart (in-memory PDF upload).
    ** PATCH updates (e.g., title change).
    ** DELETE removes item and a follow-up GET returns 404.
    \*\* Owner scoping proven by creating data for a second user and ensuring your list only shows your items.

  - Projects
    ** Create without a certificate.
    ** Create with a certificate.
    ** PATCH updates (status change; link/unlink a certificate).
    ** DELETE removes item and a follow-up GET returns 404.
    \*\* Owner scoping on list.

  - Goals
    ** Full CRUD path: create ‚Üí list ‚Üí patch ‚Üí get ‚Üí delete ‚Üí not found.
    ** Validations: negative target_projects and past deadline.
    \*\* Computed field: progress_percent updates as projects are completed and as target changes.

  - Analytics
    \*\* /api/analytics/summary/ returns the three user-scoped counts and you assert sensible minima.

  - Docs
    ** /api/analytics/summary/ returns the three user-scoped counts and you assert sensible minima.
    ** /api/docs/ and /api/schema/ both return 200.

### Notes

- Tests live in users/tests/.
- users/tests/**init**.py makes sure the folder is treated as a package and discovered automatically.
- Tests create an isolated test database and do not touch your dev data.

## üöÄ Deployment (env-based settings)

- In production, configure settings via environment variables instead of editing code.

- Create an `.env` (or set real env vars in your host) with:

            DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-strong-random-string
            DJANGO_DEBUG=False
            DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com

- Choose one of the following CORS configs:

            CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=False
            CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.example.com

**Notes**

- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` must be long & random. Never commit it.
- `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is a comma-separated list.
- Prefer restricting CORS via `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Only set `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=True` for local development.
