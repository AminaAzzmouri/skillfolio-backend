serializers.py â€” DRF serializers for Skillfolio

Purpose
===============================================================================
Serializers define how our Django models (Certificate, Project, Goal) are
converted to/from JSON for the API. They also enforce field-level constraints
and protect server-controlled fields.

Key principles used here:
- We expose all model fields via fields="__all__" for now (simple MVP).
- We mark server-owned fields as read-only so the client cannot set them:
  * user:     always set from request.user in the ViewSet (perform_create)
  * id:       auto-generated PK
  * timestamps: created_at / date_created are server set

If custom validation is needed (e.g., disallow past deadlines), we can add
`validate_*` methods or an overall `validate()` method in the serializer classes.

    Converts Certificate model instances <-> JSON payloads.

    Read-only fields:

    Notes:
      - To restrict future dates for `date_earned`, we might add a validator
        (example provided below, commented out).
      - File uploads (file_upload) are supported via multipart/form-data.
