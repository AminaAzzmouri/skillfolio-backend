"""
users/admin.py â€” Django Admin Config for Skillfolio

Purpose
===============================================================================
Expose the core models (Certificate, Project, Goal) in the Django admin so
developers and admins can browse, search, and manage data efficiently.

Highlights
- Certificate: searchable and filterable; recent-first ordering by date_earned.
- Project: custom list columns (title, owner, linked certificate, status, etc.)
  to make scanning many items quick and informative.
- Goal: quick filters on deadlines and created_at; simple search.

Notes
- The admin is only for trusted users; API clients should use the DRF endpoints.

    Custom admin config for Project.

    Why this customization matters:
    - Admin list views default to showing only __str__().
    - By surfacing key fields (owner, status, link to certificate, created date,
      guided fields), admins can audit content and relationships at a glance.
